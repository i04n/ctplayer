The build.xml file requires Apache ant.

You can download it here: https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

After you un-archive it to a directory make sure it's on your system path then:

> cd ctplayer/build-script
> ant

that will begin the build process for ctplayer.

Make sure you git cloned the flex_sdk_3 from the nginadfoundation Github to the ctplayer/flex_sdk_3/flexsdk directory as well as it is needed to compile the project.
